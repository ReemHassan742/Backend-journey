# Backend-journey

From heart to heart — not a professional thing.
As a young girl who always feels late for everything, while everyone around me seems to be at the top of the race, I'm not even close.
I'm trying to be patient on this journey until I reach something — anything — that will make me feel calmer than I do right now.

I didn’t have much luck at the beginning of my studies.
I never made excuses to make myself feel better or less guilty about the situation I ended up in.
It was just a hard start — a little girl with no mentor, no helper, not even a friend who had walked this road before.

You may not know anything about me, but… just wish me luck.
